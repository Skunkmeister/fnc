# Next steps

The topics in this chapter come mainly under the heading of *approximation theory*, on which there are many good references. A thorough introduction to polynomial interpolation and approximation, emphasizing the complex plane and going well beyond the basics given here, is~{cite}`TrefATAP`. A more thorough treatment of the least squares case is given in~{cite}`DavisInterp`.

A thorough comparison of Clenshaw–Curtis and Gauss–Legendre integration is given in~{cite}`TrefCCvsG`.

The literature on the FFT is vast; a good place to start is with the brief and clear original paper by Cooley and Tukey~{cite}`CooleyTukey`. A historical perspective by Cooley on the acceptance and spread of the method can be found at the SIAM History Project at \verb+history.siam.org/pdf/jcooley.pdf+ (reprinted from Nash {cite}`Nash90`).  The FFT has a long and interesting history.

Doubly exponential integration, by contrast, is not often included in books. The original idea is presented in the readable paper~{cite}`TakahasiMori`, and the method is compared to Gaussian quadrature in~{cite}`Bailey2005`, which is the source of some of the integration exercises in \secref{improper}.
